# Living Streams Dev
Website Technical Test 2016

# Requirements
- npm - 'npm install' (packages.json defines the packages needed)
- grunt - default task 'grunt watch' to compile and minify css, uglify and jshint js. Run on root directory (where the Gruntfile.js) is stored.

# Editing CSS
- edit the css/src/style.less locally
- grunt watch will compile the less and store the resulting minified css in css/live/style-min.css

# Given More Time
- I'd tidy up the top gallery, I only realised this was a slider at the last minute!
- I'd add touch/draggability onto the the sliders and carousels making them more responsive
- Add a drop down menu and use the correct icons on the .top .tools
- Convert all smaller images to sprint and use that in place of the current icons in e.g. .tools and nav (although I've tried to use fontawesome where possible for speed).
- A few notes in js about different ways to do things
- I'd find a more professional picture of myself to sneak into the site.


# Notes
- There are a lot of freely available sliders/carousels out there I could have used. I'm not one to unecessarily reinvent the wheel but instructions seemed to suggest you wanted it written from scratch.
